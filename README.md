## 🚀 Glitch Amelioration in Gravitational Waves

This repository contains files for a machine learning project on intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) detection using gravitational waves. It focusses on ameliorating glitches in gravitational wave signals originating from cosmic events with intermediate mass black holes.

## 📝 Project Folder Setup

* 📁 **data**: contains the data files used for this project.
* 📁 **main**: contains the scripts that we have written ourselves.
* 📁 **lib**: contains the scripts that we have from an external source.
* 📁 **info**: contains the documentation for this project.
* 📁 **model**: contains the generated data, including settings and the neural network weights.

## :information_source: Project Script Setup

The model consist out of a framework (`modelframe.py`) which contains the general settings and training loop for the different neural networks that are trained (`models.py`). The code includes two jupyter notebooks that run certain model setups and generate data. An additional notebook makes relevant plots of the model metrics. There are three additional python scripts that include code for plotting, data loading and other utilities.
